#PIG DICE

#Author: Joshua Kimani.

#Description

This project is a Dice game called Pig dice.

#Gameplay

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

1.If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

2.If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

3.If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

~The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
